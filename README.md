Customers visiting the store can browse through the available itmes and add them to their shopping cart. The cart has attributes such as the total number of items and the total amount. Each customer can have multiple carts. Customers are also identified by their personal attributes, incuding name, phone number, and email. This information helps the store to manage customer accounts, track their purchase history, and personalzed services.

For the payment process, customers can choose from various modes of payment. The goal of the system is to enable seamless management of inventory, customer accounts, shopping carts, and transactions.
